Lab 7


Where I used jQueryUI: To make the heading (Lab 7) at the top dissapear with a highlighting effect if you click on it.

Where I used bootstrap: To make the table, color the table with alternating stripes, and to color the descriptions blue.

I performed a number of commits to git. This semester I really wanted to learn how to use git, so I'm really glad that through this project I got to get more comfortable doing that.

Thanks again for the extension.

People I worked with:
