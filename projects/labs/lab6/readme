Explain what each of your classes and methods does, the order in which methods are invoked, and the flow of execution after one of the operation buttons has been clicked.

Also explain how the application would differ if you were to use $_GET, and why this may or may not be preferable.

Finally, please explain whether or not there might be another (better +/-) way to determine which button has been pressed and take the appropriate action
